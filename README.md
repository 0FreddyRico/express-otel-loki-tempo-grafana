Welcome to the **Express OpenTelemetry Loki Tempo Grafana Stack** repository! This project demonstrates how to set up a mock API server using Express.js while integrating various tools from the LGTM stack. 

## Overview

This repository aims to showcase the power of logging and tracing in Node.js applications. By using OpenTelemetry, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana, you can gain insights into your applicationâ€™s performance and behavior. The setup is designed for developers looking to explore observability in their applications with a focus on simplicity and clarity.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/0FreddyRico/express-otel-loki-tempo-grafana/releases) section. Make sure to execute the downloaded files to set up the environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container Docker applications.

You can check your installations by running:

```bash
node -v
docker -v
docker-compose -v
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0FreddyRico/express-otel-loki-tempo-grafana.git
   cd express-otel-loki-tempo-grafana
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Docker containers**:

   Use Docker Compose to set up the services. Run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command starts all necessary services in the background.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start the API server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the mock API. You can interact with the API endpoints to see how logging and tracing work in real-time.

### Example Endpoints

- **GET /api/items**: Fetches a list of items.
- **POST /api/items**: Creates a new item.

You can explore the logging and tracing capabilities by making requests to these endpoints.

## Observability Stack

### OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry provides a framework for observability. It collects metrics, logs, and traces from your application. This repository uses OpenTelemetry to monitor the Express.js application effectively.

### Loki

Loki is a log aggregation system designed for efficiency. It integrates seamlessly with Grafana, allowing you to visualize logs alongside your metrics and traces.

### Tempo

Tempo is a distributed tracing backend. It helps you analyze the performance of your services by providing trace data. This repository integrates Tempo to show how traces are captured and visualized.

### Grafana

Grafana is a powerful visualization tool. It allows you to create dashboards to monitor your application's performance. This project includes Grafana configurations to display metrics, logs, and traces.
